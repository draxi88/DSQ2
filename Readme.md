# Quake2 Dark Stroggs
Dark Souls style Quake 2.

**What's different from regular Quake 2?**

**Health:** You can no longer pick up healthpacks in maps. You need to regenerate your health at the spawn. *(From now on called bonfire)*
You can also drink a few shots of health each respawn.

**Stamina:** You can no longer run all the time. Your stamina will run out, and you need to walk/wait for it to go back up again.

**Soulpoints:** Stroggs drops a soul. Collecting it will increase your soulpoints. If you die you will loose all your soulpoints, but you can collect your own soul and get them back.

**Weapons:** You can upgrade weapons in exchange for soulpoints at the bonfire. Upgrading weapons will increase their dealt damage.

**Respawn:** When you "regenerate" at a bonfire, all monsters will respawn. If you die yourself, you'll respawn at the bonfire.


You can also upgrade Stamina and Health at the bonfire.



**Other:**
"info_player_start" works as the bonfire from Dark Souls. 


**Commands:**
- "drink_health" - increase your health.
